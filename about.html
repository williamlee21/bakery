          Hello! Welcome to the website for Dollie's Bakery that is located in
          NYC. My name is Jennifer Au-Yeung or my friends know me as Dollie. My
          story starts off as somebody who was on a quest to find herself. I
          worked as a registered dental hygienist for six years and loved it.
          But I always felt like something was missing from my life. It wasn’t
          until after I had my son that I took on baking as a fun hobby. It was
          an area where I could express my creativity that I was suppressing for
          so long. I became a stay at home mother who wanted to become an
          inspiration for her son.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I started baking macarons, there was a satisfaction that I
          received from it that I could not explain. They looked so decadent and
          elegant in every way. I couldn’t believe that I was able to create
          such a beauty in my kitchen. From there, I started serving them to
          friends and family members and it became a sensational hit. Everybody
          loved them and raved about how I should sell them. Even those who
          don’t like sweets at all in my family wanted more. That was when I
          knew I wanted to pursue further with my macaron adventure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every macaron that I make is made with love and special care. I’m a
          one-woman baker who makes sure that every macaron is perfectly filled
          and a work of art before it leaves my hands.
